# Building robots with Rock and Syskit

Rock is a software framework for the development of robotic systems. Rock
provides all the tools required to set up and run high-performance and reliable
robotic systems for wide variety of applications in research and industry. It
contains a rich collection of ready to use drivers and modules for use in your
own system, and can easily be extended by adding new components.

This website focusses on building robot systems based on Rock and Syskit,
Rock's system management layer. It will not cover issues related to Rock's Ruby
and C++ execution APIs, or only in cases where these plug Syskit limitations.

The most important aspect of this documentation is to explain both the _how_
and the _why_, i.e. describe the parts of Syskit that are relevant to manage a
robot system, but also to explain the underlying design principles that allow
you to build a _manageable_ system.

A Rock newcomer should read this documentation sequentially. Tutorials and
examples are mixed with more detailed descriptions, with an aim at being progressive.

## Basics

1. [Installing Rock, day-to-day handling of packages](installation.html)
2. [Running a simple system using Gazebo and Syskit](syskit_basics.html)
3. The development and runtime workflows

## Building systems
