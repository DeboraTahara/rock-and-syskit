# Installing Rock

Rock's current release requires **Ruby 2.1 or later**

 1. Install Ruby and verify that the version matches

    ~~~
    sudo apt-get install ruby
    ruby --version
    ~~~

 2. Create and "cd" into the directory in which you want to install the toolchain.

    ~~~
    mkdir dev
    cd dev
    ~~~

 3. Download autoproj's bootstrap script

    ~~~
    wget http://rock-robotics.org/autoproj_bootstrap
    ~~~

 4. Bootstrap your installation. This installs autoproj and checks out
    the build configuration, but does not check out packages

    - if you want to create a new workspace based on the latest release, do

    ~~~
    ruby autoproj_bootstrap \
        git https://github.com/rock-core/buildconf \
        tag=<%= config[:latest_release] %>
    ~~~
      
    - if you want to use the `stable` or `master` flavors, do

    ~~~
    ruby autoproj_bootstrap \
        git https://github.com/rock-core/buildconf
    ~~~

 5. Update and build the installation's default packages.

    ~~~
    aup --all -k
    amake --all -k
    ~~~

 5. Important: as the build tool tells you, you **must** load the generated env.sh script at the end of the build !!! You must also do in new terminals before you can interact with the Rock installation

**Next**: [day-to-day interaction](day_to_day.html)
