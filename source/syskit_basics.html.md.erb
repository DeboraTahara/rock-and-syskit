# Running a simple system using Gazebo and Syskit

Rock and Syskit provide a seamless integration with Gazebo. We will leverage
this integration in this section to discover how to use existing components to
build and control a minimal system. This should give you a hint about what Rock
offers at runtime as well as the basics of package and component management.

This will cover building a simple system and simulating using Gazebo. It will
only base itself on existing components (no new components will be developed).

This section assumes that you have a [bootstrapped Rock
installation](../installation.html).  All examples that have to be run inside a
terminal assume that you have sourced this installation's `env.sh` file in the
current terminal.

When applicable, we will breach advanced topics, or explanations about how
things are implemented under-the-hood. These will be clearly indicated by
a box, just like this one.

We'll be following this flow (click on the steps title to go directly there):
