# HowTo

1. Install middleman (you might need to add `sudo` to the command):

    `gem install middleman`

2. Clone the repository:

    `git clone git@github.com:rafaelsaback/rock_website.git`

3. Go to the repository's folder and run:

    `bundle exec middleman`

And voil√†! The website should be available from your localhost. Just read the middleman messages to know how exactly to open it in the browser.
